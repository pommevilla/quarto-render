# A Github Action to Render Quarto Documents (DEPRECATED)

## **THIS GITHUB ACTION IS NO LONGER BEING MAINTAINED**

 **It is recommended to use the official suite of [Quarto Github actions](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions).**

---------------------------------------------------------

This repository stores the `quarto-render` [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) for use with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) projects. This action will call `quarto render` on the root directory of the repo. It also has example workflows for some common uses centered around web publishing.

## About updates and Quarto releases

Since Quarto is still in rapid development, the version of Quarto used in this action won't be updated with every Quarto release. The latest release version of this Github action will be pinned to a last known stable version. That said, if you want to make sure that you're using a reasonably new version of Quarto when you use this action, it is recommended to use the `@main` tag when using this action as opposed to a specific release number.

## Examples

### Rendering a static `quarto` site and pushing to `gh-pages` branch

If your quarto project has `freeze: true`, you can use this Github action to render your documents and publish your workflow to Github pages by using something like the following workflow:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/render-and-publish.yaml
name: Render and deploy Quarto files
on:
  push:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  quarto-render-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: "Install Quarto and render"
        uses: pommevilla/quarto-render@main

      - name: "Deploy to gh-pages"
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./_site
```

- See [here](https://github.com/pommevilla/friendly-dollop) for an example page that runs this workflow with `freeze: true` that has both Python and R code.
- Read more about using freeze in your Quarto project [here](https://quarto.org/docs/books/book-authoring.html?q=freeze#freezing).

### Installing Python or R dependencies before using `quarto-render` and publishing results to the `gh-pages` branch.

You can use `quarto-render` with Quarto projects that aren't frozen by first reinstalling the packages used by your documents before rendering.

- For R libraries, use `renv` to capture dependencies for your RMarkdown code and use it to restore your environment in your workflow.
  - Example job steps are [here](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/ci.html#github-actions-1).
  - Read more about `renv` at the [package site](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).
- Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to capture Python package requirements. You can then restore your environment via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Note that if you are on a Windows machine and running a Github workflow on a non-Windows image, then the above command should be modified to `pip freeze | grep -iv "win" > requirements.txt` to avoid capturing Windows-specific pacakges in your `requirements.txt`. These packages will cause errors when attempting installation on non-Windows machine.

Below is the workflow used [in an example repository](https://github.com/pommevilla/hinterland-harbor) to restore the Python and R dependencies required for its documents before rendering them with the `quarto-render` Github action and pushing them to the `gh-pages` branch with `action-gh-pages` ([link](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages)).

```yaml
# .github/workflows/render-and-publish.yaml
name: Render and deploy Quarto files
on:
  push:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  quarto-render-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      RENV_PATHS_ROOT: ~/.local/share/renv
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - uses: actions/setup-python@v2

      - name: "Install Python deps"
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v1

      - name: "Install curl for Bioconductor"
        run: |
          sudo apt -y install libcurl4-openssl-dev

      - name: "Install R Packages: Cache packages"
        uses: actions/cache@v1
        with:
          path: ${{ env.RENV_PATHS_ROOT }}
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-renv-${{ hashFiles('**/renv.lock') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-renv-

      - name: "Install R Packages: Restore packages"
        shell: Rscript {0}
        run: |
          if (!requireNamespace("renv", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("renv")
          renv::restore()

      - name: "Install Quarto and render"
        uses: pommevilla/quarto-render@main

      - name: "Deploy to gh-pages"
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./_site
```

- See [here](https://github.com/pommevilla/hinterland-harbor) for an example repository that implements this workflow.
- While it is possible to use `quarto-render` in this way, you'll have a much better experience using `freeze`. See [here](https://github.com/pommevilla/hinterland-harbor#you-should-probably-use-freeze) for some more discussion.
